## Usage

To use the provided configurations, extend the respective configuration files in your project's configuration:

## ESLint

Create an `.eslintrc.cjs` file in the root of your project and extend the `@vngn/codestyle/.eslintrc.cjs` configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@vngn/codestyle/.eslintrc.cjs'],
  // Add any project-specific rules or overrides here
};
```

## Prettier

```js
module.exports = {
  ...require('@vngn/codestyle/.prettierrc.json'),
  // Add any project-specific Prettier configurations here
};
```

## Babel

Create a `babel.config.js` file in the root of your project and extend the `@vngn/codestyle/babel.config.json` configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: '@vngn/codestyle/babel.config.json',
  // Add any project-specific Babel configurations here
};
```

## TypeScript

Create a `tsconfig.json` (or `tsconfig.production.json`) file in the root of your project and extend the `@vngn/codestyle/tsconfig.*.json` configuration:

*development:*
```json
{
  "extends": "@vngn/codestyle/tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "build",
    // Add any project-specific TypeScript configurations here
  }
}
```
*production:*
```json
{
  "extends": "@vngn/codestyle/tsconfig.production.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "build",
    // Add any project-specific TypeScript configurations here
  }
}
```
